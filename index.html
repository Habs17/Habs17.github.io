                    I was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky where I grew up playing soccer and enjoying time outside. 
                    Threads of family, sports, and friends have defined my life path and experiences. 
                    I am entering my final year at the University of Kentucky where I am studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering. 
                    By being a part of the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society, I'm able to volunteer in my community. I am excited to continue positively impacting my community and growing professionally.
